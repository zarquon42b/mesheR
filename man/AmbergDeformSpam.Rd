\title{Deform triangular mesh based on correspondences}
\usage{
AmbergDeformSpam(mesh, lm1, lm2, k0 = 1, lambda = 1, S = NULL,
  Hchol = NULL, clean = FALSE, ridgetol = 1e-08)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{triangular mesh of class "mesh3d". No loose vertices, edges and
degenerated faces are allowed.}

\item{lm1}{m x 3 matrix containing correspondences on "mesh"}

\item{lm2}{m x 3 matrix containing target correspondences}

\item{k0}{integer: parameter regularizing face normal distortion.}

\item{lambda}{numeric: parameter regularizing faces's distortion.}

\item{S}{optional: object from function createS from previous calculation.}

\item{Hchol}{Cholesky decomposition of Hessian (obtained by a previous run of AmbergDeformSpam), speeds up things significantly.}

\item{clean}{logical: if TRUE, \code{vcgClean} from package Rvcg is run to remove duplicated and unreferenced vertices from the mesh and preventing segfaults.}

\item{ridgetol}{in case of a singular matrix, this value will be added to the diagonal (similar to a ridge regression) to avoid singularity.}
}
\value{
\item{mesh}{deformed mesh}
\item{Jn}{Jacobi submatrix Jn}
\item{Jc}{Jacobi submatrix Jc}
\item{J }{Jacobian matrix}
\item{H }{Hessian of J, class "spam"}
\item{Hchol}{Cholesky decomposition of H; class"spam"}
}
\description{
Perform smooth deformation of a triangular mesh, minimizing per-face
distortions.
}
\details{
Perform smooth deformation of a triangular mesh, minimizing per-face
distortions.No loose vertices, edges and degenerated faces are allowed, as
they lead to singular equation system.
